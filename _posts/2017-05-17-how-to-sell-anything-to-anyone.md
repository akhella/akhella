We all engage in selling on a daily basis. We sell products to our customers, proposals to our clients, design directions to our managers, and business ideas to out investors.

And when we are trying to sell something, we mostly focus on what we are selling, and we try to show all the great features it has, and the amazing results it will deliver.

But what if this is the wrong way to do it?

What if the best way to sell anything is so simple, and yet so counter-intuitive, that most of us miss it?

So why is it counter-intuitive?

Because it turns out that, to sell something, you need to talk less about it!

Let me illustrate with a quick story that taught me the biggest lesson in selling.

A couple of years ago, I was in the market for a new car. I walked into a dealership, and was greeted by a salesperson who asked me which car I was looking for. He then started telling me about how amazing their cars are, and about all the cool features they come with. I listened, test-drove a couple of models, then left the dealership unable to make my mind.

I received a follow up call a couple of days later, and decided to return for one final test drive.

When I showed up at the dealership, the first salesman wasn't there, and I was greeted by another salesman who asked me a question that the first one never asked: 

"What do you really care about in a car?"

He patiently listened as I told him about my criteria, then stood up and said: "let's go for a test drive!"

And that test drive was much different!

Instead of telling me about all the great features the car had, he told me how safe I would feel driving it, how much fun I would have with it, and how much money I would save on gas (it was a diesel). And instead of letting me drive around at my own leisure, he guided me through a couple of maneuvers that left a big smile on my face (it turned out that braking from 90 to zero is as thrilling as accelerating from zero to 90 - not recommended if you love your tires and break-pads too much!)

We went back to the dealership, and I signed the contract!

Did you notice what the second salesperson did differently?

First, he asked me what I cared about.

Then, he listened to what I wanted, and inquired further about why I wanted it.

When I was done, he answered every question I had, then showed me how his car delivered the results and benefits I cared about.

He then shut up, and waited while I made my decision on my own. He never tried to push or oversell.

And did you notice how he spoke about his product less than 25% of the time, and still made the sale?

When trying to sell something, it seems counter-intuitive to listen instead of talk, to focus on the other person instead of focusing on your product, and to show only a couple of benefits instead of outlining all its features.

But this is how successful salespeople do it!

That's how we all buy.

And this doesn't just apply to in-person sales. In fact, it works online too!

For instance, when I design a new product's landing page, I create the simplest one possible, and I add a chat widget to the page. I then answer as many visitors' questions as possible, and I redesign the page to reflect the most frequently asked questions.

It's like reading people's minds!

So next time you're trying to sell a product, a service, a design direction, or an idea, use the magic selling formula: ask, listen, answer, then wait.

And if you're listening carefully, people will tell you exactly how to sell them anything!
