Have you ever dreamt of building the next Facebook or AirBnB? 

Was the dream so big that you felt overwhelmed, paralyzed, and didn't know where to start?

And have you been rejecting many small ideas that wouldn't become the next billion dollar unicorn startup?

Ten years ago, I was in that place. I remember reading about Google acquiring YouTube for $1.6B and thinking: "I can do that! I can build the next YouTube!"

So I left my full time job with no idea what to work on next. I was so focused on winning the next startup lottery: the funding, the exit, and the write-up on TechCrunch, that I didn't care about having a plan B, or even a plan A.

And for the following 4 years, I worked on absolutely no idea. I was freelancing and consulting, which was bringing good money, but I ignored every idea that I had along the way, because they weren't "big enough", and they weren't going to "change the world" or "put a dent in the universe".

Then in 2010, I decided to stop consulting, and to start working on one of my own ideas. And, like every good Silicon Valley wantrepreneur, I started thinking big. I dreamt up a business platform that combined everything a company would need to make and ship products: from managing ideas and tasks, to collaboration and communication, to prototyping, to product lifecycle management and customer support!

I even applied to a startup accelerator, and got accepted solely on the merit of that idea.

But the vision and plan that I had cooked up seemed so overwhelming, and I was too paralyzed to do anything. I didn't want to mess up the execution of my well crafted dream, and the best way to do that was to never start.

A couple of months later, I still had done nothing. No product. No users. Not even a line of code. So I dropped out of the accelerator and decided to give up on the idea altogether.

A week later, I was reviewing the "vision documents" and "business plans" that I had created, when I noticed a bullet point at the very bottom of one of those documents that said "help people make app prototypes quickly". I have been using Keynote to make prototypes for my clients, and I was creating some iOS UI templates for the first iPad that I had purchased.

At that point, I was desperate to launch anything, even if it were a free product. So I wrote a blog post about how I used Keynote to prototype iPad apps, packaged the UI templates that I had been creating, made them available for free download at the bottom of the post, and shared it with anyone who cared.

That post became the foundation for <a target="_blank" href="http://keynotopia.com">Keynotopia</a>, my first product business. Six years later, that business is about to cross the 100,000 customer mark!

Not only did Keynotopia provide a healthy revenue and momentum to work on many other products, it also gave me a platform to learn everything I needed to grow a product business: SEO, SEM, traffic building, copywriting, split testing, advertising, selling, and running an online business with a virtual team.

Had I ignored that small idea and waited for something big, I would have probably gone back to consulting, or would have gotten a full time job.

And let me tell you something that I haven't shared with anyone before.

During the early days of my online business, I felt uncomfortable telling my Silicon Valley buddies about it; Because while they were busy building the next big unicorn startup and changing the world, I was building UI kits, recording design and prototyping courses, and running a small profitable business of one.

But I learned along the way that changing the world starts with helping one person, then 2 people, then 10 people, then 100, and so on...

And I learned that any small dent in the universe counts!

Many of the startups that my buddies were building failed, and served no one along the way. I admired their sincere effort and their ability to dream big, but I also recognized that success isn't defined by having the next Facebook or AirBnB, but by making something that helps others have a slightly better day, a slightly easier job, by giving them a product that they recognize for its value and pay for it.

So if you've been waiting for the next big idea, start small instead. 

Make something this week, or this weekend, that solves ONE small problem for ONE person who is willing to pay ONE dollar for it.

Then figure out how to sell it to 2 people, then 10, then 100.

Or find out ONE small task that you perform on a daily basis that can be productized or automated, turn it into a small product, and find out if ONE of your peers, managers or clients would pay for it.

And if you already have a big idea, find ONE small feature that you can create as a stand-alone product in a week or less, prototype it, then reach out to your target audience and find out if ONE person would pay for it. 

Remember: Facebook started as a student app for Harvard campus, and AirBnB started as an air mattress sharing app for San Francisco design conferences attendees.

Most unicorns start as caterpillars.

The momentum, experience, and revenue that you get from launching ONE SMALL PRODUCT will carry you effortlessly into bigger ones.

You never learn until you launch, so launch small, and launch soon.
