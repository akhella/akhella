<p>I hung up the phone and sat shaking on the floor. <strong>What have I just done?</strong> Blood rushed to my head, and I realized that I'd been holding my breath probably since the phone rang. A let a long exhale out, and glanced once more at the contract in my hand...</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>Everything I wanted was there: the salary I'd asked for, the relocation benefits and the starting date. And the company logo was also there. It reminded me how it had been my childhood and teenage dream to just visit that company. The same company that I'd just turned down a dream offer to work at.</p>
<p>The phone rang again. It was my best friend, probably calling to ask about when I am starting with the new job. I didn't answer; I wouldn't be able to tell him why I just said "thanks, but no" to the biggest special effects studio in the world. I didn't know if he'd understand that, after more than two weeks of negotiation with them, I had a "gut feeling" that I shouldn't do it.</p>
<p>This morning, I drove by the studio on my way to get a cup of team and it made me wonder whether I made the right decision three years ago. I remembered reading that <strong>successful people don't always make the right decisions. Instead, they make decisions, then make them right. </strong>I realized that there is probably no way for me to know if I made the right decision, because that path no longer exists. But I am grateful for one thing: that I made a decision, and I moved forward to make it the right one for me. I went on to work with over a dozen startups, two of whom already got acquired, launched <a href="http://blog.amirkhella.com/2010/09/21/the-story-of-keynotopia-how-i-launched-a-profitable-product-in-3-hours/">a successful product</a>, and getting ready to launch a second one.</p>
<p>I strongly believe that there are very few "bad decisions" we make in life, and whatever they are, we can make them right by learning from the results and moving forward. I also believe that if we take the path of heart, the one that's free from desire and fears, we'll seldom make bad decisions. We might stumble into failures from time to time, but those wrong turns are probably there to teach us things we needed to learn, meet people who will help us in the next turn, and grow into the person we need to be for the next challenge.</p>
<p>So instead of standing by the start line trying to figure out the race, take time to get in touch with your inner compass and take a leap forward. Chances are you'll never end up where you've originally planned to be, but most probably you'll end up in a much better place if you keep making decisions and making them right.</p>
<p>Finally, to quote the bhagavad gita, <em>“It is better to strive in one’s own dharma than to succeed in the dharma of another. Nothing is ever lost in following one’s own dharma. But competition in another’s dharma breeds fear and insecurity.”</em></p>
