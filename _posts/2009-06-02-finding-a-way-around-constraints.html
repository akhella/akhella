<div><span lang="EN"><span style="font-family: Arial;">An old Italian lived alone in New Jersey. He wanted to plant his annual tomato garden, but it was very difficult work, as the ground was hard.<span> </span>His only son, Vincent, who used to help him, was in prison. The old man wrote a letter to his son and described his predicament:</span></span></div>
<div></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Arial;">Dear Vincent,</span></div>
<div></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Arial;">I am feeling pretty sad, because it looks like I won't be able to plant my tomato garden this year. I'm just getting too old to be digging up a garden plot. I know if you were here my troubles would be over. I know you would be happy to dig the plot for me, like in the old days.</span></div>
<div></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Arial;">Love, Papa</span></div>
<div></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Arial;">A few days later he received a letter from his son.</span></div>
<div></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Arial;">Dear Pop,</span></div>
<div></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Arial;">Don't dig up that garden. That's where the bodies are buried.</span></div>
<div></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Arial;">Love,</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Arial;">Vinnie</span></div>
<div></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Arial;">At 4 a.m. the next morning, FBI agents and local police arrived and dug up the entire area without finding any bodies. They apologized to the old man and left.</span></div>
<div></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Arial;">That same day the old man received another letter from his son.</span></div>
<div></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Arial;">Dear Pop,</span></div>
<div></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Arial;">Go ahead and plant the tomatoes now. That's the best I could do under the circumstances. </span></div>
<div></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Arial;">Love you,</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Arial;">Vinnie</span></div>
