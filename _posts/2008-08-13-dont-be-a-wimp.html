<p>In Non-Designer Design Handbook, Robin Williams gives a very valuable advice on design (and life). I quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<h2><strong>Don't be a wimp</strong></h2>
<p>Don't be afraid to create your Design (or your Life) with plenty of blank space-it's rest for the eyes (and the Soul),</p>
<p>Don't be afraid to be asymmetrical, to uncenter your format - it often makes the effect stronger.</p>
<p>It's okay to do the unexpected.</p>
<p>Don't be afraid to make words very large or very small; don't be afraid to speak loudly or to speak in a whisper. Both can be effective in the right situation.<br />
Don't be afraid to make your graphics very bold or very minimal, as long<br />
as the result complements or reinforces your design or your attitude.</p></blockquote>
