<blockquote>
<p>Two young MBA couple graduated and landed great jobs in California. They realized that they had some time before their job starting date, so they flew to California a couple of weeks earlier and enjoyed spending their days on the beach.</p>
<p>One day, the Devil walked by and saw them, so he approached them and said: &quot;Hey. I see that you are enjoying your time here. I have a proposal for you:</p>
<p>I will offer you everything you ever dreamt about: fame, success, money and prosperity for as long as you and everyone of your descendant shall live. In return, I need you to offer me one thing: your soul.&quot;</p>
<p>The couple looked at each in bewilderment, then looked back to the Devil and asked: &quot;What's the catch?&quot;</p>
