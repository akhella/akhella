<p>Today I asked myself: <em>Whom am I listening to?</em></p>
<p>Every day, I am presented with dozens, if not hundreds, of voices and opinions.</p>
<p>The voices of news anchors, journalists and bloggers.</p>
<p>The voices of book authors and narrators.</p>
<p>The voices of actors and show hosts.</p>
<p>The voices of my teachers.</p>
<p>The voices of my family and friends.</p>
<p>And the voices of my past and future.<!--more--></p>
<p>All these voices present a pointer to some truth, but the truth itself waits to be <span style="text-decoration: underline;">real</span>ized. It's not real unless it's within me.<br />
That's why I usually don't get someone's advice until I personally have an experience that I can reflect upon and realize.</p>
<p>Most of these voices don't present truth, but they show opinions. Mostly second hand opinions.</p>
<p>But within me, I always had a faint voice. One that's very hard to hear unless I turn down all other voices, including my own, and sit quietly.</p>
<p>That voice always knows something that I don't, and it's been trying to tell me all along.</p>
<p>And this voice has been right every single time.</p>
<p>I experienced the bliss of following that voice when I trusted it without questions,</p>
<p>and the miseries when I let my mind interfere, rationalize, and tried to find a better alternative to that voice.</p>
<p>And sometimes that voice is very loud. Loud enough to save my life from a definite danger.</p>
<p>Like that day I was driving through an intersection and this voice yelled "STOP". I obeyed, and I found a car running the red light and heading toward my side of the car, missing it by less than an inch and spinning in the middle of the road to a stop.</p>
<p>I remember how loud that voice used to be when I was a child. Loud and clear. It told me at every moment what I needed to do.</p>
<p>Even before I remember understanding a spoken language, that voice communicated without words.</p>
<p>Then I learned how to speak, and how to listen.</p>
<p>And I started listening to everyone, and everyone never stopped speaking.</p>
<p>And that voice retreated in a corner inside me waiting for a moment of silence to be heard again.</p>
<p>Most of these moments came when I am doing something that's either relaxing, or requiring my full attention.</p>
<p>And I started to understand and respect the mysterious nature of that voice, even when it doesn't make sense.</p>
<p>And the fact that it communicates beyond knowledge. It communicates truth.</p>
<p>Not universal truth. Not agreeable or rational truth.</p>
<p>My truth.</p>
<p>It mentions places, people, things to do, and things not to do. Then it falls silent, waiting for me to show a bit of faith before it speaks the next truth.</p>
<p>And that leap of faith is all that voice needs to start speaking again.</p>
<p>And I learned that I cannot sit down and wait for it to tell me everything before I start moving.</p>
<p>I need to move. To act. And when I do, I feel it gaining more courage, and more volume to speak a bit louder.</p>
<p>Sometimes I doubt it and think that it may be just <em>my own voice. </em>But I go back and realize that there is no way I could have known the things that voice is telling me.</p>
<p>Listening to that voice makes me feel like a kid again. Connected to mystery rather than just knowledge. Comfortable with the uncertainty of tomorrow, rather than trying to create a plan for it. Knowing that I do have a companion, a mentor, who knows everything and will reveal the truth at the right moment.</p>
<p>When asked "<em>If there is heaven, what would you like to hear God saying when and if you go to there?</em>", Steven Spielberg replied "<em>Thank you for listening".</em></p>
