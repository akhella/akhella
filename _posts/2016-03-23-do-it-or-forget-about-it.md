Have you ever been in a situation where a friend is telling you about a successful product that someone launched, or you read in the news about a startup being acquired, and you sigh and say "You know? I had the same idea a couple of years ago!"

I've been there at least a dozen times, and I learned my lesson the hard way: when an idea comes your way, either do it, or forget about it.

I used to have those lists of ideas that I would like to execute on some day, but that "some day" never came. I got busy again with the things I was doing, and I totally forgot about them.

The only ideas that turned into products and businesses are the ones that I started executing on immediately. Some succeeded, some didn't go anywhere, but I learned something valuable from each one of them.

Most importantly, I learned how to execute fast!

When I got the idea for Keynotopia, I sat down and created the first version in 3 hours. The website didn't look great, the product was basic and limited, and I was worried I would find a line of people knocking at my door the following day asking for their money back. But I launched it, and it worked. I validated my idea in just one evening.

With Axutopia and GUIToolkits, I didn't have a product yet, so I created the websites over a weekend, put some photos, created a cart button, and measured conversion for a couple of months with Adwords. Once I saw enough numbers that the products are worth creating, I created them.

StatusPanda took a bit longer to create, and I didn't know anything about ReactJS or GoogleScript when I started writing it. Three weeks later, I'd become pretty good in both, I had a finished beta, and the first paying customer. It's easier to improve it from that point, because there is momentum!

In my old mindset, I would have purchased a couple of Javascript books/courses, and took my time learning it in order to do it the right way. I would have probably gotten too busy with other stuff later on,and would have never launched it. But I no longer care about things being "done right". Instead, I want to first get them done, and then get them right.

If there is ONE skill that you need to master in order to succeed, it is to eliminate time between inspiration and execution. Whenever you have an idea, start working on it right away. Even if you don't know how to design it or code it, just make a "fake" version of it so you can play with and show others.

And that's why you have Keynotopia templates; so you can make a rapid prototype of any idea, as soon as you have it, in just a couple of hours!

It helps you eliminate that excuse of "I don't have yet the skills to know how to do it".

And once you have a working prototype, the momentum will carry you forward.

May your ideas never end up in the graveyard!
