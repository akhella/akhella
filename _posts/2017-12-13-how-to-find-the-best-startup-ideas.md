What is the right process for coming up with the best product ideas?

Do you sit down every morning to write down 25 new ideas until your brain hurts?

Do you lock yourself up with your team in a meeting room to brainstorm until the whiteboard is full?

And how do you decide which idea to pursue, and to spend your time (and money) to turn into a product?

Is it the one that excites you the most?

Is it the one that you can execute the fastest?

Or is it the one that most of your team voted on?

Over the past couple of months, I implemented a simple life hack that made product ideas come so effortlessly that I felt stupid for not having done it earlier.

It also helped me easily find out which ideas are the best ones to work on first.

Previously, I have been keeping an ideas notebook where I would occasionally jot down random ideas for creating new products or improving existing ones. Later, I renamed that notebook to the ideas graveyard, because I never ended up implementing any of them.

Most of those ideas felt so random, and reading some of them later on made me wonder “what was I thinking?”

That’s why I decided to start another notebook called pains and frustrations, and instead of jotting down random ideas, I started writing down every pain point I was having during the day. I made it a habit that, whenever I felt angry or frustrated about something not working out the way I expected, was taking too much time, or was costing me lots of money, I would grab my notebook and start writing down the scenario that led to that frustration. 

I would then jot down some ideas that can solve that problem.

And I didn’t have any difficulty coming up with multiple ideas for each pain point. Defining a problem concretely provided the clarity and constraints needed for the right ideas to emerge.

The process felt like mental alchemy: transmuting the negative energy of anger and frustration of dealing with a problem into the positive energy of coming up with creative ideas to solve it.

In the span of 3 months, I accumulated enough ideas to work on for the next 3+ years!

Those ideas were solving problems that I am personally having, and that many others are likely looking to solve, so I am naturally excited to work on most of them.

So how do I then decide which idea to work on next?

I created a simple spreadsheet that helped me prioritize all those pain points.

I provided 4 different scores (on the scale of 1 to 10) to each idea:

- Pain Level: How much pain is this problem causing me on?
- Value: How likely am I to pay someone to solve that problem?
- Frequency: How frequently am I dealing with this problem?
- Popularity: How many others is this problem impacting?

Adding up those 4 different scores provides a total score that I can sort my ideas by, and decide which ones to work on next.

This is an objective idea prioritization process, and provided me with a low risk / high reward framework for choosing the highest potential ideas.

If I don’t know the answer for one or more of those evaluation questions, I email/call/meet some people who are likely to be dealing with the same frustration and ask them.

I’d like to invite you to follow this process for the next 30 days, and see for yourself how well it works.

- Buy a small notebook, or create a new folder in your favorite note taking apps (I used Apple Notes because it’s fast). 
- Make it a habit to write down every frustration and pain point as soon as you have it, along with some ideas on how to solve it.
- Whenever you need a new idea to work on, create the idea evaluation spreadsheet and score your ideas.

To your success!
