<p>Once upon a time, there existed a village that was completely inhabited by blind people.&#160; </p>
<p>One day, an elephant came to the village.</p>
<p>Since none of them had ever seen an elephant before, they all gathered around the animal to figure out how it looked like.</p>
<p> <!--more-->
<p>The man who touched the trunk said: &quot;An elephant is like a thick tree branch&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;No! It's like a pillar,&quot; said another who touched the leg.</p>
<p>&quot;You're both wrong!&quot;, said a third who touched the tail, &quot;the elephant is like a rope.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh No!&quot;, shouted another who was feeling the belly, &quot;it's like a wall&quot;</p>
<p>And a man who was touching the tusk said &quot;Come on, guys! The elephant is nothing but a solid pipe&quot;.</p>
<p>They began arguing and fighting, and each of them insisted he was right.</p>
<p>They were getting agitated and frustrated at each other.</p>
<p>A wise man was passing by the village, when he heard the shouting.</p>
<p>He stopped and asked: &quot;What's the matter?&quot;</p>
<p>So they told him that they could not agree about what an elephant was, and each told him what he thought it looked like.</p>
<p>The wise man smiled and said:&#160; &quot;</p>
<p>All of you are right.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>But because each one of you touched a different part of the elephant,</p>
<p>you all had different images of what an elephant looked like.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>And because each one of you imagined an elephant through his own experience,</p>
<p>doesn’t mean that the other person’s image of the elephant is wrong.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>An elephant has all the features that you described, and much more.</p>
<p>But you can never tell what an elephant is by just touching one part of it.&quot;</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Let's not forget that each of us is looking at a different version of reality; a small aspect of life that's colored with our own perception and experiences.</p>
<p>The more we accept to see life through other people's perspective, the richer version of it we will have.</p>
