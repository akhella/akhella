If you’re stuck in a job that you don’t like, should you listen to the popular advice “follow your passion and money will follow”? Or should you go for the equally popular advice: “you won’t make money from your passion, just keep doing what you’re already good at”?

The answer is both and neither!

Let me explain.

I’ve always followed my passions: I picked computer science over medicine because I loved programming, I did my graduate work in human computer interaction instead of networks or computer vision because I loved creating interfaces and visualizations, and I’ve transitioned from software engineering to product management to design to entrepreneurship, because I was passionate about every single one of them.

In every case, following my passion paid off emotionally and financially.

But it worked for one simple reason: I put in the time to learn what I was passionate about, and to turn it into a skill that I can use to deliver something of value to others.

Some people believe they should stop whatever they are doing to follow their passions. They also believe that the world will happily dump money in their laps to reward them for their courage.

I’ve seen several friends quit their jobs on a whim to start doing something completely different, only to be stressed out and in debt a couple of years later.

The world will not pay you to follow your passion.
But it will pay you for using what you’re good at to create something useful or entertaining. So to follow your passion successfully, you need: 1) time and practice to become good at what you’re passionate about, and 2) to use your new skills deliver something of value to others.

And that takes time.

One trick that I’ve used to take that time is to find ways to integrate my new passions into what I was already doing.

For instance, instead of quitting my job as a product manager to become a UX designer, I became a better PM by learning design and integrating it into my work. Instead of quitting design to do art, I became a better designer by integrating lots of sketching into my design process. And instead of quitting business to become a writer, I grew my business by writing about my products and the lessons I’ve learned.

I’ve used passion as a bridge, not a parachute.
Not only does this provide you the time needed to become good at it, it also helps you create instant value with your passion, and get paid for it.

So instead of asking yourself whether you should quit your job or follow your passion, ask yourself how you can integrate your passion into your current job, making it more enjoyable and profitable, and then deciding later on whether you should do it full time.

Give it the time and practice it needs to become a useful skill, before you ask your passion to pay you back.
