<p>Last year has been good. It's been actually good beyond our wildest expectations.<br />
We met great people, worked with amazing startups, and enjoyed designing a wide range of exciting products and services.</p>
<h2>Here are some of the highlights of 2008:</h2>
<ul>
<li>In January, blist was shown to the public for the first time in Demo 2008.  Blogs raved about the product, its slick user interface and its ease of use, and Kevin Merritt's presentation became the #1 most watched video on DEMO's website. It was one of the most fulfilling experiences for us given the amount of work and number of iterations that were put in the product up to that point.</li>
<li>In February, we started working with Delve Networks (formerly Pluggd) on their new platform and user interface. We worked with the executive and product teams during 6 months to create user experience roadmaps and innovative UI and interactions. In June, Delve showcased their new user interface which was received with great praise and provided the company with a competitive edge over existing platforms.</li>
<li>In February, we also started working with inCampus on the new version of the product. We provided them with strategic design and product planning advice that helped them compete against existing products and win student's audiences in several universities.</li>
<li>In May, we started working with UStream TV on the redesign of their product. UStream is one of the most fun and exciting team to work with. Two months later, UStream released a redesigned homepage, and numerous social and viral features were added to the site.</li>
<li>In August, we met with the DocVerse team who told us about their plans to take over the document collaboration world. We loved their vision and charisma so much and committed to helping them realize it. DocVerse was one of the product that we surprised ourselves with the outcome, being one of the most fruitful and elegant projects we've worked on so far.</li>
<li>Finally, in September, we started working with Stuart Skorman and his team to bring the ClerkDogs vision to reality, solving many conceptual and visual challenges and accelerating the product release, which was raved about in the press and blogosphere.</li>
</ul>
<p>At the end of the year, we realized that we worked on a social mainstream database, a media publishing platform, a social commerce application, a web streaming site,  a document collaboration software, and a movie recommendation engine.</p>
<p>That's a handful of diverse projects that we never imagined working on in just one year. And we learned a lot from working with driven, positive entrepreneurs who want to change the world. Their charisma has been a constant inspiration to us, and their attitude towards problem solving always reminded us why we are doing this in the first place.</p>
<p>But what we learned the most, is that no matter what we are designing, the goal is the same: to empower people to do more than what they imagined themselves capable of doing in the first place. To make them unleash their creativity and enjoy some blissful moments of flow. To create extensions of their minds that enable them to express themselves and connect with others.</p>
<p>That's the power of good design. And that's what we strive for in every moment.</p>
