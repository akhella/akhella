Running a service business is a rollercoaster ride, and most of the time, it's not a fun one!

The reason most people start freelancing, consulting, or running a service agency is that they don't want to deal with corporate environments, managers, meetings, and bureaucracies. 

So they start because they want to work on fun projects, deliver good work, and see it used by millions of people.

But once you start a service business,you get a harsh reality check.

Instead of sitting comfortably in your home office, sipping your morning coffee and sketching your ideas for the current client project, you're writing proposals, answering emails, sending invoices, looking for new leads, and working with current clients.

Instead of the freedom, flexibility, and work/life balance you were hoping to achieve, you're up late at night wondering when your client will pay the overdue invoices, and whether the next client will show up before the current contract is over.

At that point, you're left with three options: hire people to do the work while you handle the business (boredom), keep doing everything yourself (burnout), or go back to a full time job.

In March of 2010, I was facing the same dilemma: I was running a 6-person design consultancy, and I was splitting my time equally between boredom and burnout.

We were working on exciting projects, and we loved our clients, but I was constantly feeling that I was spinning the hamster wheel of existing projects and new clients indefinitely.

We needed a break to think about our options...

As soon as the last contract was over, we decided not to work on client projects again for a while, and took sometime off to reflect.

We looked at the things that our clients (and team) struggled with, where we wasted most of our time, and how we solved those challenges.

We also looked at all the resources we've designed for ourselves and our clients, and the processes we've created and refined to deliver great work.

We then realized that we wasted most of the time in feedback loops with users and clients, who wanted to provide their ideas and feedback visually, but were intimiated by complex tools like Photoshop and Illustrator. 

We also realized that when we switched to using Keynote and PowerPoint for prototyping, our clients were using the same tools to provide feedback much faster. We even landed some big contracts with prototypes that we created on the fly, during an initial client meeting.

I didn't know if that was a viable business idea, so I decided to share our prototyping process, and the UI kits we'd created to speed up our process, with others.

People loved idea, and downloaded the UI kits. That weekend, I created Keynotopia to sell them online, and to teach people how to use them.

I had accidentally turned our service business into a product business, simply by sharing our internal resources and processes, and what we've learned along the way.

We spent the following couple of years improving the product, launching more products, and learning marketing, PR, SEO, advertising, copywriting, and the challenges and joy of running a product business.

Looking back, the most defining moment of switching from a service business into a product business was when dozens of people had paid for our product while I was asleep. 

Instead of trading time and skills to get paid once, the time and skills are used to create value that is sold many times over.

Instead of having a couple of client paying $10K each, you have thousands of customers paying $100 each.

And if you stop working, your product is still working for you. And that's by far the biggest advantage of a product business over a service business: leverage and scale.

That was the path that provided the freedom and flexibility of freelancing, along with the predictability and certainty of a full time job, and with a profit margin that beats both.

If you're looking to turn your service business into a product business, here is what I recommend:

- Spend a couple of hours every weekend reflecting on everything you and your team learned and created during the previous week.

- Write a weekly blog post and/or newsletter to share those resources, lessons and tricks with potential clients and fellow designers. Worst case scenario, you'll just get more clients!

- Keep an eye on challenges and pain points that your clients repeatedly ask you to solve. Can you turn part of the service you provide into a DIY product for your clients?

- Keep an eye on the challenges that your team deals with on a daily basis. Are other service providers having the same challenges? Can you create a solution for your team that other freelancers and agencies can use?

- Don't try to turn your entire service offering into a product. Instead, try to find one problem that you can solve with a simple idea.

- Learn how to launch products, build traffic, do proper SEO/SEM, and advertising. You'll need many of those skills for your service business anyway.

There is a lot more that I can share about this topic, but I've already written a long enough post.
