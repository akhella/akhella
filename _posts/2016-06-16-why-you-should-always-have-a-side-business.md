I want to share with you today the biggest epiphany I've had in the past ten years.

I remember that morning as if it were yesterday. It was June 2010, a couple of days after launching <a href="http://keynotopia.com" target="_blank">Keynotopia</a>, and I woke up to find that, several people had bought my product and deposited money in my bank account while I slept the night before. My product worked for me while I was asleep, and it was such a huge mindset shift that I had to sit down and take it all in.

Until that day, I had worked all my life either as employee or freelancer/consultant. I had been working trading time for money, and it was the first time I made something that made money on my behalf, even while I wasn't working on it.

I had a system in place that showcased the product, took customer's payments, delivered the product, and transferred the money to my bank account.

I didn't have to work an extra hour to get those additional overnight customers.

From that point forward, my income didn't depend on the hours I was working. It was one of the best feelings ever!

To illustrate this shift, let's look at the difference between being an employee, a freelancer/consultant, and an entrepreneur:

As an employee, you earn fixed income, plus some bonuses, commissions and raises. It doesn't matter how much time you spend to finish the job, the relationship between your income and your time is mostly a constant, as illustrated below.

Things change a bit when you start freelancing or consulting: you can put in more hours, and make more money. The more you work, the more you earn. Instead of serving ONE employer, you're serving multiple clients. The relationship between your time and your income is now linear, as illustrated below.

However, you have a limited number of hours in your day, and a limited number of clients you can work with at once. In other words, there is a limit to your income, and it's hard to scale, unless you turn it into a service agency, which typically reduces your profit margin to a single digit, and adds lots of management overhead.

This brings us to the final and best income model, which is to have your own profitable product. When you create a product, you spend some time upfront doing market research, interviewing customers, finding pain points, prototyping solutions, iterating, and developing the product. That is time that you are not paid for. But then when you launch the product, assuming you did the previous steps right, it starts earning money for you, even during the time you're not working on it. The time you spend on marketing  and product development starts to yield exponential results. Your income is finally decoupled from your time, as illustrated below.

That's why I strongly advise people to launch their own products, even if it's on the side while they are doing their full time jobs. Not only is it a great way to earn money on the side, it's also an awesome way to provide value to others and share the things we learn every day.

A couple of hours in the evenings, along with a few more hours on the weekends, will enable you to launch a couple of products every year!

Hopefully this helps you transition from making money, to making products that make you money.
