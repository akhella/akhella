<p>During the 2008 web 2.0 expo in San Francisco, I held a round table discussion about design thinking for start-ups. The premise of the discussion was to 1) learn the difference between design (the artifact) and design thinking (the mindset), and 2) to discuss how to integrate best practices for design thinking into the product life-cycle. Start-ups running on shoestring budget cannot typically afford big consulting agencies like <a id="aptureLink_oszKwKEjhx" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IDEO">IDEO</a>. But that shouldn't stop them from becoming design-driven, and use the available tools and processes to differentiate through design and user experience. If you'd like to get your company up to speed with design thinking best practices and tools, <a href="mailto:amir@fictiv.com" target="_blank">get in touch with me</a> for an on-site training session.</p>
