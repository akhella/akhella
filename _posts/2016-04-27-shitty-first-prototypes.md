Have you ever wondered what separates people who get results and achieve progress from people who don't? 

Hint: it has nothing to do with luck, skills, or resources.

I mentioned earlier that when you get an idea, you should either do it right away, or just forget about it. Acting as soon as you are inspired is the best way to beat procrastination and make ideas happen. Otherwise you'll  add that idea to your "list", you'll get busy, and you'll probably forget about it, until someone else runs with it.

The second trick to execute on your ideas is that you need to act as fast as you can. Acting soon guarantees that you start when your inspiration hits, and acting fast makes sure you're done before inspiration vanishes.

The whole point is to CAPTURE the whole idea while it's still all in your head, and while you're still excited about it.

If you need to learn a new design tool or programming language, your inspiration would be long gone before you're done learning. This means that you're much better off executing your ideas with tools you already know, like Keynote or PowerPoint, then learn what you need to create the next version.

And this is where things get interesting: to capture the whole idea fast, with the tools and skills you already have, you would need to create what I call "shitty first prototypes". The first prototype you create is not to show others, but is for you to capture the full idea. It focuses your mind on capturing the big picture, without getting lost in the detail.

This idea has been popular among writers, especially Anne Lamott, and it's perfectly applicable to making any kind of product. 

Your shitty first prototype is a total throw-away. You may not even reuse anything from that prototype in the next iteration, but you would have captured the whole idea while it's still in your mind, and you would have momentum because you acted as soon as you were inspired.

Shitty first prototypes also take the pressure off and the seriousness out of the process, so you're also taking it easy and having fun with it.

Once you finish a shitty first prototype and interact with it, you'll have lots of ideas on how to change it, improve it, or even throw it away and make a completely different one.

I cannot emphasize enough how important it is to make your first prototypes as soon as possible, as fast as possible, and as shitty as possible.

Do you have an idea for a book? write a shitty first draft for yourself. Got an idea for an app? Grab your favorite prototyping tool, and make a shitty first prototype. Want to make a physical product? Grab some cardboard boxes, tape and pair of scissors, and build a shitty first model.

Act soon, act fast, and make lots of shitty first prototypes!
