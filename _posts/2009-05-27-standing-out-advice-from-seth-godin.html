<p>In his book, Purple cow, Seth Godin gives very valuable advice on how to stand out from the crowd.  Here are some key points from the book:</p>
<ul>
<li>Being remarkable doesn't mean likable. Remarkable means "worth making a remark about". Whether it's positive or negative, that's up to you.  Or as Oscan Wilde put it: "the only thing worse than being talked about is not being talked about"</li>
<li>You need to figure out who cares about your business, and cater to these customers.</li>
<li>Being normal is boring. Being very good is the opposite of being outstanding. Being safe is risky.</li>
<li>Once you have a purple cow, milk it to the last drop. Create a team of milkers who take full advantage of your success, and a team of innovators who create your next purple cow.</li>
<li>Differentiate your customers, and cater to the most profitable and reward the most influential ones.</li>
<li>Pick an underserved niche in your industry and cater to their needs. Pick the smallest conceivable market and create a product that's remarkable enough to overtake it. Make it fresh and intriguing. And market it to those who desperately need it.</li>
<li>Being remarkable isn't always just about the product. It may be the way you pick up the phone, or the way <a href="http://www.zappos.com" target="_blank">you care about your customers</a>.</li>
<li>Make your product or service conversation-provoking. Make it an idea and a story that spreads.</li>
<li>Find the influencers and target them. They will create a great word of mouth campaign for you.</li>
<li>Examing your four P's (Product, Pricing, Positioning and Publicity), determine your outer limits, get out on the edge, and don't be afraid of getting started.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/159184021X?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eleofpas-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=159184021X">The book</a><img style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/ir?t=eleofpas-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=159184021X" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" /> is a light and enjoyable one, and I strongly recommend it for anyone who wants to start a business and succeed by being remarkable.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">And here is a video presentation by Seth from TED about the same topic.</p>
